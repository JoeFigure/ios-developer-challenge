# Streetbees iOS developer challenge 

### Description
Using the best API available on this side of the universe [https://developer.marvel.com/](https://developer.marvel.com/) make a simple master detail app that allows the user to scroll through all the comics ever released and view details for each comic.

You will need to sign up for a free developer account with Marvel.

### Functional requirements (Using the Job to be Done framework)

- When I open the application I want to see a list of all Marvelâ€™s released comic book covers ordered from most recent to the oldest so I can scroll through the Marvel universe (and please, let me see the cover picture while I do it!)
- When tapping on a comic it should open up a detail view controller showing the cover art as well as the title, description and a list of the characters in it.
- You should be able to swipe to page between the different comics. Don't worry about providing a paging indicator.

### Technical requirements
- Application must be developed for the iPhone with Swift 4, iOS 11 and xcode 9.
- You are free to use whatever frameworks or tools you see fit
